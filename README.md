## Conclusion

Within the course of completing this assignment, I learned the most about the process of applying node.js, npm packages, and the application of es6 within my javascript. What I struggled with the most at the beginning was just understanding the concepts of node, it just felt really new to me; the application of different npm packages, going through new documentation of how to apply the new modules felt really convoluted at first, but now I can see how useful it can be. Though I've only scratched the surface of es6, I am excited to learn more new ways I can apply that version of javascript to write cleaner/more efficient code. My personal favorite is the way template strings are applied; it made creating this application a bit easier. My biggest motivation in completing this assignment was that I was constantly running into concepts that I did not understand; such as understanding node and alot of es6 concepts. If I don't understand a concept, it drives my curiosity. I think what will make my project stand out is how clean the pdf file is portrayed!
